# GCP / GKE sample project

## GCP engines
**GCE (Google Compute engine)** is Google’s IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering. GCE allows you to create your own virtual machine by allocating hardware-specific resources, e.g. RAM, CPU, Storage. It’s almost like building our own computer/workstation and handling all the details of running it.

**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** is GCP’s Container as a Service (CaaS) offering, which allows customers to easily run their Docker containers in a fully managed Kubernetes environment. It provides you very fine grained control over everything about your cluster.

**GAE (Google App Engine)** runs your apps with as little configuration/management as possible.
